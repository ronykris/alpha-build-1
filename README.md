# Aztec Wallet Application

This project is a wallet application that interacts with the Aztec network, a privacy-focused layer 2 solution for Ethereum. The application allows users to create accounts, send transactions, read contract data, bridge tokens between Ethereum and Aztec, and perform private and public token transfers.

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Functionality

- [x] Create a New Account
  - [x] Create a new account with a specific key
- [x] Send transactions to the application
- [x] Read contract data from the application
- [x] Connect to Ethereum and Aztec
- [x] Bridge tokens to/from Ethereum to Aztec with private and public claiming
  - [x] See the status of a transaction
- [x] Privately and publicly send tokens to other accounts

### Stage 2: ZK Proofs with Basic Functionality

- [ ] Client-Side Proving
- [ ] Think More +

### Stage 3: Extra + Uniqueness

- [ ] Chrome Extension
- [ ] Local Storage Attack Prevention
- [ ] Research problems in current wallet systems

## Context

The Sandbox is a local environment of the Aztec network execution context. It does not do any real proving or verifying of zero-knowledge proofs, they are just mocked, so this rapidly increases the pace of development. Once projects have been developed and tested on the Sandbox, they can be tested on a devnet or (upcoming) testnet (dates TBD).
